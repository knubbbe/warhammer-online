The preferred way of installation is via the Curse client. Just click the 
"install via curse client" button at 
http://war.curse.com/downloads/war-addons/details/kwestor.aspx. 
The latest version and all dependencies will then be automatically installed
for you.

If you manually install HealGrid, please make sure that you COMPLETELY remove
the HealGrid-folder from your addon-folder before you install the latest
version.
